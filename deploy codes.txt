Now, your deployment commands would be:

For development:
# In the root directory

    npm run dev

This will start both your React development server and your Express server concurrently.

For production:
# In the root directory

    npm run deploy:prod

This will build your React app, then change to the server directory and deploy to Google Cloud Run.



npx concurrently "npm run start" "npm run start:server"
